#shortly-angular
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com).

Shortly-Angular is an exercise in designing an Angular application using a Node.js powered Express server. It provides a link-shortening service and route handler for correctly parsing and responding to requests made to shortened URL paths.
